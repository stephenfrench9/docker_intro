Observations:


********App.py********
The python script app.py has an object called 'app' from the Flask library.

The python script app.py has an object called 'cache' which is associated with
port 6379.

The app is told to run on 0.0.0.0

The function that is associate with root of 0.0.0.0 is called hello()

hello() executes a continuous loop, calling an increment method of the cache
object.


********docker-compose.yml********
There are two services, the web service and the redis service.

The webservice is constructed from my current directory.

There are two declared ports, 5000 and 5000. (conjecture: one is the port
that the container will broadcast to, and the other is the port that the
programs that are executing inside of it will broadcast to)

The redis service is downloaded from docker. I know that is has a default
port (When somebody wrote the Dockerfile for this image, they included
EXPOSE 6379) (Question: do containers sprung from this image have a default
name 'redis'?)


********Dockerfile********
The current directory on my host machine gets imported into this container

python app.py gets typed into the command line of the container
