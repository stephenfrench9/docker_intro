****Dockerfile****
you name the image to base this all on, you say some files to iclude in the
image

****commands****
build an image
run the the image

The build command is pretty much: docker build image_name
But you do explicity say which directory will be turned into an image

The run command can be more complicated. You give your container a name.
You say what image to use. But you also tell it which ports to expose.

Conjecture: when you name ports for nginx in the format %%%%:%%%% the first
number is the number that you will visit in your browser, and the second
number is the default port for the internals of  nginx.
